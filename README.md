# Global inequality

In this repository I use mainly the js library [arquero](https://www.npmjs.com/package/arquero) to load, join and transform the data from the [World Inequality Database (WID)](https://wid.world/) for a new data visualisation and storytelling project.

## Loading.js

In this script all individual country files are loaded in order to combine them with the option to select different timeframes as well as variables.
The correponding code can be found [here](js/loading.js).

## Join.js

In this second step the final file is join with the general country file from WID to create a final dataset including all variables needed as well as applying some transformation [here](js/join.js).
