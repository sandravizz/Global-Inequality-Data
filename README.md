# Global inequality

Using the [World Inequality Database (WID)](https://wid.world/) for a new data visualisation and storytelling project.

## Arquero.js

To install arquero.js, please find the documentation [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/arquero). 

## Loading 

So the first step was to load the files and create one final file, which includes all data for the years and value (in this case gini) we want. 
The correponding code can be found [here](js/load_all_data.js). 

## Join 

Afterwards we want to add all relavant country information to this final file. The correponding code can be found [here](js/data_join.js).

## Wrangeling 

Afterwards for running the first visualisations, we need to change the data format, filter, aggregate etc. The correponding code can be found [here](js/data_wrangeling.js).
