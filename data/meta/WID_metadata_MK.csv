However it is the only income concept that has an internationally agreed definition (established by the United Nations System of National Accounts, see SNA 2008).

This indicator does not include emissions associated with individual consumption and government collective expenditures. While these estimates provide WID.world's best efforts to measure emissions inequality across the world, it should be noted that estimates quality is “low to very low“ given poor data quality and availability on pollution in most countries. It should also be noted that there are different ways to measure carbon footprints, which can lead to different takes on the issue (inequality in emissions is lower when looking at consumption-related emissions only and increases when factoring in investment-related emissions).

Estimates represent emissions associated with individual investments (i.e. these are emissions associated with “capital formation“, attributed to individual who own firms). This indicator does not include emissions associated with individual consumption and government collective expenditures. While these estimates provide WID.world's best efforts to measure emissions inequality across the world, it should be noted that estimates quality is “low to very low“ given poor data quality and availability on pollution in most countries. It should also be noted that there are different ways to measure carbon footprints, which can lead to different takes on the issue (inequality in emissions is lower when looking at consumption-related emissions only and increases when factoring in investment-related emissions).

MK;kntghgi999;999;i;North Macedonia;National territorial emissions ;National income aims to measure the total income available to the residents of a given country. It is equal to the gross domestic product (the total value of goods and services produced on the territory of a given country during a given year), minus fixed capital used in production processes (e.g. replacement of obsolete machines or maintenance of roads) plus the net foreign income earned by residents in the rest of the world.// National income has many limitations. However it is the only income concept that has an internationally agreed definition (established by the United Nations System of National Accounts, see SNA 2008). So we use it as our reference concept (with tax havens correction). To be improved.The national economy - in the national accounts sense - includes all domestic sectors, i.e. all entities that are resident of a given country (in the sense of their economic activity), whether they belong to the private sector, the corporate sector, the governement sector.;;Per-capita emissions;Per capita emissions ;individuals;The base unit is the individual (rather than the household).
