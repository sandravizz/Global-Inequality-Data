This indicator does not include emissions associated with individual consumption and government collective expenditures. While these estimates provide WID.world's best efforts to measure emissions inequality across the world, it should be noted that estimates quality is “low to very low“ given poor data quality and availability on pollution in most countries. It should also be noted that there are different ways to measure carbon footprints, which can lead to different takes on the issue (inequality in emissions is lower when looking at consumption-related emissions only and increases when factoring in investment-related emissions).

Estimates include emissions embedded in imports and exports of goods and services. This indicator represents emissions associated with individual consumption and government collective expenditures. This indicator also includes a component representing emissions associated with individuals' investments. While these estimates provide WID.world's best efforts to measure emissions inequality across the world, it should be noted that estimates quality is “low to very low“ given poor data quality and availability on pollution inequality in most countries. It should also be noted that there are different ways to measure carbon footprints, which can lead to different takes on the issue (inequality in emissions is lower when looking at consumption-related emissions only and increases when factoring in investment-related emissions).
