Estimates represent emissions associated with individual investments (i.e. these are emissions associated with “capital formation“, attributed to individual who own firms). This indicator does not include emissions associated with individual consumption and government collective expenditures. While these estimates provide WID.world's best efforts to measure emissions inequality across the world, it should be noted that estimates quality is “low to very low“ given poor data quality and availability on pollution in most countries. It should also be noted that there are different ways to measure carbon footprints, which can lead to different takes on the issue (inequality in emissions is lower when looking at consumption-related emissions only and increases when factoring in investment-related emissions).

Estimates represent emissions associated with individual investments (i.e. these are emissions associated with “capital formation“, attributed to individual who own firms). This indicator does not include emissions associated with individual consumption and government collective expenditures. While these estimates provide WID.world's best efforts to measure emissions inequality across the world, it should be noted that estimates quality is “low to very low“ given poor data quality and availability on pollution in most countries. It should also be noted that there are different ways to measure carbon footprints, which can lead to different takes on the issue (inequality in emissions is lower when looking at consumption-related emissions only and increases when factoring in investment-related emissions).

However it is the only income concept that has an internationally agreed definition (established by the United Nations System of National Accounts, see SNA 2008).
