Estimates represent emissions associated with individual investments (i.e. these are emissions associated with “capital formation“, attributed to individual who own firms). This indicator does not include emissions associated with individual consumption and government collective expenditures. While these estimates provide WID.world's best efforts to measure emissions inequality across the world, it should be noted that estimates quality is “low to very low“ given poor data quality and availability on pollution in most countries. It should also be noted that there are different ways to measure carbon footprints, which can lead to different takes on the issue (inequality in emissions is lower when looking at consumption-related emissions only and increases when factoring in investment-related emissions).

These estimates are then anchored to GDP (see GDP variable for details). The estimates of national accounts subcomponents in the WID are based on official country data and use the methodology presented in the [URL][URL_LINK]https://wid.world/document/distributional-national-accounts-guidelines-2020-concepts-and-methods-used-in-the-world-inequality-database/[/URL_LINK][URL_TEXT]DINA guidelines[/URL_TEXT][/URL]. We stress that these subcomponents estimates are more fragile than those of main aggregates such as national income. Countries may use classifications used are not always fully consistent with other countries or over time. Series breaks with no real economic significance can appear as a result. The WID include these estimates to provide a centralized source for this official data, so that it can be exploited more directly. We encourage users of this data to be careful and to pay attention to the source of the data, which we systematically indicate.";;
